<h1>Jack's Web Development Blog</h1>

<h3>Blog 1 - September 3 2021</h3>

<p>This week begins my Web Development class, in which I learned some basic elements of HTML. Some of these elements include<br>
     <p2>&lth1&gt &ltp&gt &ltimg&gt</p2>, which were all fairly intuitive and straightforward to use. Nesting different elements<br>
        such as the body and the head sections of the page are a bit confusing, but still easy to get used to. Here's an example of <br>
        how nesting can be slightly confusing :<br>

<p> What was suprisingly easy to do was add references to content online, including images. Anything found on google images can be used
    as long as you have the link </p>

<h3>Blog 3 - September 9 2021</h3>

<p> This week, a useful element we learned about was style sheets. We used internal stylesheets in particular, which could be set <br>
    within the html page. These stylesheets are useful when you would like to use a repeated element within the same page. For example <br>
    the following code is actually its own style sheet - 
</p>

<p3>p3 {

    color: lightblue;
    background-color: lightgrey;
    border-style:dashed; 
    border-color: black;

}</p3>

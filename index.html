<h1>Jack's Web Development Blog</h1>

<h3>Blog 1 - September 3 2021</h3>

<p>This week begins my Web Development class, in which I learned some basic elements of HTML. Some of these elements include<br>
     <p2>&lth1&gt &ltp&gt &ltimg&gt</p2>, which were all fairly intuitive and straightforward to use. Nesting different elements<br>
        such as the body and the head sections of the page are a bit confusing, but still easy to get used to.<br>

</p>

<p> What was suprisingly easy to do was add references to content online, including images. Anything found on google images can be used
    as long as you have the link </p>
